/// Creating a new object from an existing object.

// shallow copy:

/*
 With a shallow copy, any object pointed to by the source is also pointed to by the destination. So only one object will be created in the memory. A copy of a class object is a shallow copy.

 Shallow copies are faster than deep copy, because of sharing the reference only. The created copy doesnâ€™t entirely create a new instance in memory, just address/reference is copied.

 As reference is shared, value change in a copy changes all the other. So in race condition and multi-thread issues, a shallow copy is risky.

// Deep Copy:

/*
 A deep copy is the value type of copy. When a structure is copied, it is deep type copy.

 Deep Copy duplicates everything. With a deep copy, any object pointed to by the source is copied and the copy is pointed to by the destination.

 In the case of a race condition and multi-thread issue, there is no worry about impacting other copy while changing in a copy. In a deep copy, there are multiple copies and there is no relation among the copies.

 Deep Copy is slower than Shallow Copy.
